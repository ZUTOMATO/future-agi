# TH-7247 Unified Property Catalog Design

Status: implemented locally with focused gates green; DEV deployment/backfill
is pending; no production rollout is authorized.

## 1. Objective

All property definitions must be searched and paginated from one ClickHouse
table. Callers must not merge system properties, custom attributes, evals,
annotations, dataset columns, or simulation definitions in the frontend.

The public contracts remain:

- `GET /tracer/dashboard/metrics/` — unified definition search and keyset
  pagination.
- `GET /tracer/dashboard/filter_values/` — unified value lookup routed by the
  selected stable `property_id`.

Property definitions are unified. Large fact/value populations remain in their
native stores and are reached through a server-owned value adapter.

## 2. Pre-release reset decision

Schemas 025–027 and their six DEV tables were never activated in production.
The isolated DEV tables were empty and were removed during the pre-release
reset. The clean unified implementation is now in the working tree; the DEV
tables have not yet been recreated, backfilled, qualified, or activated.

The replacement table inventory is exactly:

1. `property_definition_catalog`
2. `span_attribute_value_catalog`
3. `property_catalog_checkpoints`
4. `property_catalog_activations`
5. `property_catalog_deliveries`
6. `property_catalog_source_streams`

Only `property_definition_catalog` contains property definitions. The value
table contains selectable observed span-attribute values. The other four tables
are control-plane ledgers, not parallel definition catalogs.

The catalog is installed only from three clean CREATE-only schema files:

- `025_property_catalog_data.sql`
- `026_property_catalog_state.sql`
- `027_property_catalog_delivery.sql`

## 3. Definition row contract

Each row represents one versioned property-to-visibility binding. Required
columns are grouped below; exact ClickHouse types are pinned in schema 025.

### Tenant and publication identity

- `organization_id`, `workspace_id`
- `catalog_epoch`, `catalog_revision`, `build_token`, `projection_version`
- `binding_id` — domain-separated SHA-256 over tenant, scope, adapter, and
  stable property identity

`build_token` identifies one immutable attempt at a revision. Both definition
and hot-value rows carry it, and it must match the signed delivery envelope.
Rows from an abandoned or failed build are therefore never reinterpreted as
part of a later successful activation.

### Visibility

- `visibility_scope`: `always`, `workspace_default`, `project`,
  `agent_definition`, or `dataset`
- `visibility_id`

Workspace searches read already-projected workspace bindings. Project-filtered
searches read the workspace/always rows plus only the authorized project
bindings. The API never infers tenancy from a client-supplied UUID.

### Stable property identity and routing

- `property_id` — namespaced public identity
- `property_kind`: `system_attribute`, `custom_attribute`, `eval_template`,
  `eval_config`, `annotation`, or `dataset_column`
- `category`, `category_rank`, `source_rank`
- `definition_source`, `primary_source`, and bounded `source_tokens`
- `value_adapter`

Examples include `system_attribute:traces:model`,
`custom_attribute:customer.plan`, `eval_config:<uuid>`,
`annotation:<uuid>`, and `dataset_column:<uuid>`.

### Search and rendering

- `name`, `display_name`
- `sort_name_folded`, `search_text_folded`
- `value_type`, `output_type`, and `role`
- bounded canonical `definition_json` (maximum 32 KiB)
- `definition_sha256`

Folded strings are produced by the shared codec, not by ClickHouse `lower()`.
Python and Go golden fixtures must prove identical Unicode folding and JSON.

### Version and deletion state

- `source_adapter`, `source_version`, `source_fingerprint`
- `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`
- `state_sha256`, `emitted_at`
- producer stream and sequence identity

Deletes and lost visibility relationships are tombstones. A later restore is a
new live version. Rows are never physically removed from an active cursor
epoch.

## 4. Source adapters

| Adapter                 | Definition source                                         | Visibility output                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System manifest         | One canonical checked-in manifest                         | Always/workspace plus source-specific project definitions        |
| Span attributes         | Kafka/direct collector extraction                         | Project bindings; reconciler also emits workspace-union bindings |
| Eval templates          | Tenant-scoped PostgreSQL snapshot                         | Workspace defaults and configured project bindings               |
| Eval configs            | Tenant/project PostgreSQL snapshot                        | Project bindings                                                 |
| Simulation eval configs | Active run-test/agent PostgreSQL snapshot                 | Agent-definition bindings                                        |
| Annotation labels       | Label definitions plus active project/Score relationships | Workspace defaults and project bindings                          |
| Dataset columns         | Active dataset/column PostgreSQL snapshot                 | Workspace and dataset bindings                                   |

PostgreSQL adapters use read-only repeatable-read snapshots. They do not mutate
source rows. A bounded minute-scale reconciler emits versioned rows through the
same property-catalog envelope. The durable AUTO lifecycle selects a full
streaming merge/diff when the active lineage anchor reaches 24 hours or 2,048
active revisions, repairing missed updates, relationship removals, bulk
changes, and tombstones.

## 5. Kafka/direct envelope

The transport uses one generic property-catalog envelope. It contains:

- tenant, epoch, revision, and source adapter
- producer stream, sequence, previous-payload digest
- source version/fingerprint and source-batch digest
- definition/value/tombstone counts and explicit gap outcome
- bounded chunks targeting only allowlisted property-catalog tables

The existing durable spool, deterministic JSON, SHA-256 chain, bounded chunks,
duplicate handling, and data-first/ledger-last commit order are retained.
Every chunk is fully decoded and validated before the first ClickHouse insert.

The collector continues to extract high-volume custom/system values after the
canonical span write succeeds. That hot path is acceleration only and emits no
definition rows. An authoritative bounded canonical-span reconciliation owns
the complete span-attribute definition/type union and value/source-audit proof.
Relational reconcilers publish definitions through the same transport rather
than writing a second catalog.

## 6. Epoch, revision, and activation lifecycle

An issued cursor must never observe rows moving underneath it.

1. A coordinator durably allocates a never-reused revision and build token.
   Writers publish only while that exact lease is in `building` state; every
   chunk and ledger write rechecks the fence.
2. Every expected adapter/stream must report a contiguous, terminal,
   gap-free delivery chain.
3. Checkpoints prove source counts, emitted rows, tombstones, and rolling
   digests.
4. Workspace-union attribute bindings and every relational adapter complete.
5. Qualification rejects missing adapters, count drift, same-version state
   conflicts, gaps, truncated payloads, or incomplete streams.
6. Activation atomically advances the workspace to the qualified revision.
   Readers construct a conflict-checked lineage of every successfully active
   `(revision, build_token)` at or below the cursor revision and join both data
   tables to that lineage. Aborted and disabled builds are invisible even when
   later revisions activate.
7. Old revisions remain for at least the maximum signed-cursor lifetime and
   rollback window.

Fresh definitions become visible after the next bounded revision (target two
minutes). Values remain available from their native value readers.

### Scheduled lifecycle and sidecar isolation

Steady-state reconciliation uses exactly one default-off Temporal schedule per
deployed sidecar:

- interval: 120 seconds;
- queue: `property_catalog_dev_sidecar`;
- overlap policy: skip;
- admitted scope: exactly one organization/workspace allowlist entry;
- runtime: one Python worker and one Go collector/consumer boundary sharing one
  durable POSIX volume and revision-fence/drain-proof files;
- initial backfill: explicit operator action, never scheduled;
- normal scheduled mode: AUTO, resolved to incremental or full repair from
  persisted state;
- wall: scheduled/default work is hard-capped at 100 seconds; only the explicit
  management-command initial backfill may request `--initial-backfill-wall-ms`
  in `100001..1740000`, preserving at least 60 seconds of headroom inside an
  immutable initial-build lease of at most 1,800 seconds. Scheduled and default
  revisions retain the 600-second lease;
- full repair: selected at 24 hours or 2,048 active revisions since the
  lineage anchor.

There is no separate daily repair schedule. A second workspace requires an
independent sidecar, task queue, and durable volume; a sidecar refuses an
allowlist containing more than one workspace before starting work.

## 7. Unified search and pagination

Stable order is:

```text
(category_rank, source_rank, primary_source_folded,
 sort_name_folded, name, property_id)
```

The API resolves the latest non-conflicting binding state at or below the
activated revision, applies authorized visibility, removes tombstoned rows,
deduplicates by `property_id`, and fetches `page_size + 1` with keyset
pagination. Offset pagination is not used for the new reader.

The signed cursor binds:

- organization and workspace
- exact authorized project-scope fingerprint and optional agent/dataset scope
- category, source, eval mode, normalized search, and page size
- catalog epoch/revision and activation fingerprint
- last ordering tuple

Changing any scope/filter invalidates the cursor. Retained old revisions make
the same cursor deterministic even while newer Kafka deliveries arrive. Cursor
mode deliberately returns `total=null` and `total_is_exact=false`; it never
runs an expensive count merely to decorate a page.

One endpoint wall is at most 8.5 seconds. ClickHouse receives shrinking
per-query limits below that wall, finite rows/bytes/memory/threads, and a
`page_size + 1` response cap. Deadline or completeness failure returns a typed
sanitized 503; partial results are never published as complete.

## 8. API and frontend cutover

The local implementation now has:

1. `GET /tracer/dashboard/metrics/?cursor_mode=true` reading one activated
   definition table with signed keyset pagination. The non-cursor response is a
   deprecated rolling-compatibility shape.
2. `GET /tracer/dashboard/filter_values/` routing values by validated stable
   `property_id` to the native adapter.
3. One `usePropertyCatalog` infinite-query hook used by Widget Editor,
   Trace/Span/Session/Voice property pickers, Primary Graph, Journey
   Attributes, automation rules, and dataset pickers.
4. `/api/traces/span-attribute-keys/` retained for specialized attribute-only
   compatibility/eval-mapping flows, not as the unified definition source.
5. Typed not-ready handling and guarded legacy fallback for the explicit
   rolling-compatibility paths.

## 9. Implementation and rollout state

Complete locally:

- clean six-table schemas and exact topology validation;
- Python/Go canonical codecs, durable spool, Kafka producer/consumer, and
  allowlisted ClickHouse sink;
- source adapters, bounded reconciliation, checkpoint qualification,
  activation lineage, lifecycle recovery, and daily/depth repair selection;
- single-table definition reader, value reader, signed cursors, unified API,
  frontend hook, and generated contracts;
- one-workspace, 120-second default-off DEV schedule and dedicated queue.

Still pending and deliberately not claimed:

1. Re-prove the isolated DEV target and unrelated-table fingerprint.
2. Recreate only the six catalog tables on DEV.
3. Run the explicit initial backfill with SELECT-only source reads, qualify it,
   and shadow-activate the allowlisted workspace.
4. Compare complete legacy/unified pages and run dense Whatfix, sparse
   Colektia, Mudflap voice, all nine windows, all filter combinations, and
   frontend/API latency checks.
5. Present DEV evidence and code for user review.

Production catalog schema/data remains untouched until separate user approval
after DEV evidence and code review. Historical read-only qualification does not
authorize or qualify a unified-catalog production rollout.

## 10. Mandatory proof gates

- Exact DDL/table/engine/topology inventory and zero unrelated schema drift
- Python/Go golden codec and Unicode order fixtures
- Stable concatenated pages across page sizes and Unicode edge cases
- Cursor tenant/filter/revision binding and tamper rejection
- Same-version conflict, stale replay, duplicate, tombstone, and restore tests
- Kafka poison message, crash-before-ledger, retry, and rebalance tests
- Checkpoint resume and incomplete-run non-activation
- Full source-adapter count/digest reconciliation
- Legacy/new ordered parity for all categories and scopes
- Dense Whatfix and sparse Colektia property searches and read-more chains
- 30m, 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, 180d, and 365d API matrix
- Every request below 10 seconds or a truthful typed bounded failure
- Proof that no legacy PostgreSQL or ClickHouse row was mutated

### Current local evidence

Latest recorded evidence at the local freeze is:

- 256 focused Python unified-catalog tests passing;
- five catalog/auth/server/consumer Go packages passing in normal and race
  modes;
- 278 focused frontend tests passing;
- 112 generated/filter/OpenAPI contract tests passing;
- generated-contract validation at 980 paths / 1,325 operations and registry
  coverage at 789/789;
- changed-source Ruff/format and Python compilation, Prettier/ESLint, Go
  formatting, and diff checks green.

This evidence proves the exercised local contracts only. It does not prove DEV
schema installation, backfill correctness, representative endpoint latency,
Whatfix/Colektia/Mudflap population coverage, or any production result.

## 11. DEV cleanup evidence (2026-08-14)

- PostgreSQL contained none of the proposed five projection tables, related
  migrations, triggers, or functions; no PostgreSQL cleanup was required.
- The isolated ClickHouse database contained exactly the six obsolete catalog
  tables, all with zero rows.
- Those six fully qualified tables were dropped; the database was retained.
- The 351 unrelated ClickHouse tables retained metadata SHA-256
  `a472aa975568477e2b08b28c87f2d9148e1bacbf06109ed755f22f1225c67582`
  before and after cleanup.
- No production catalog schema or data was changed during cleanup.

Current state: those six DEV tables remain deleted and have not been recreated.
No DEV backfill, activation, reader enablement, or current live API test has
occurred after the cleanup.

Before recreating the clean schema, DEV must also prove there is no pending
catalog spool or incompatible schema-version record. Any contradiction stops
rollout; it is not silently migrated.
