# TH-7247 property, filter, and list API matrix

This is the select-only release-qualification matrix for the property,
filter-value, telemetry-list, and eval-task read subset changed by this PR. It
is deliberately not the complete public-action inventory. The full changed API
and frontend-consumer inventory, including graph, navigation, export,
model-hub, annotation, and workflow actions that are not part of the Cartesian
production gate, is maintained in
[`TH7247_INTERACTIVE_READ_MATRIX.md`](TH7247_INTERACTIVE_READ_MATRIX.md).

## Logical property model

The product exposes one logical **Property Registry** and one common
property/value search contract. Every definition family is projected into one
ClickHouse definition table; high-cardinality facts and most values stay in
their native stores.

| Logical family                                  | Registry definition                                                                                                                                  | Exact value/filter source                                                                                                                             |

| System properties                               | `property_definition_catalog`; stable namespaced definitions such as `system_attribute:traces:model`                                                 | Canonical hot columns or native resource identity; observed hot values may be accelerated in `span_attribute_value_catalog`.                          |
| Custom span attributes                          | `property_definition_catalog`; project-observed namespaced key/type definitions                                                                      | `span_attribute_value_catalog` and canonical span attribute maps. A customer key named `model` remains distinct from `system_attribute:traces:model`. |
| Evals                                           | A project-bound eval configuration is `eval_config:<uuid>`; template-level catalogs use the deliberately distinct `eval_template:<uuid>` definition. | EvalLogger/native eval result tables and their exact relational filter compiler.                                                                      |
| Annotations                                     | Annotation label is the property definition                                                                                                          | Score/native annotation facts; categorical suggestions use the trigger-maintained exact value projection.                                             |
| Dataset columns                                 | Dataset plus column identity is the property definition                                                                                              | Dataset Row/Column/Cell tables and the exact dataset snapshot reader.                                                                                 |
| Prompt, dataset, project, and similar resources | Usually a generic resource property whose values are canonical ID plus display label; the individual objects are not separate property definitions   | Their native PostgreSQL resource tables, preserving identity across renames.                                                                          |

The registry identity therefore needs a source namespace/kind, stable property
ID, data type/operator capabilities, authorization-derived organization,
workspace and optional project scope, monotonic source version, and tombstone.
A bare `deleted` boolean is insufficient for observed values shared by many
facts: exact mutable vocabularies require a contribution/refcount ledger (as
the annotation projection uses), or an immutable epoch/fence (as the span
catalog uses). Public filters compile to the native source adapter; the
registry is a discovery/search read model, not a replacement fact store.

The current implementation makes that identity executable. Every cursor-mode
metric definition carries a stable `property_id` and `property_kind`.
`/tracer/dashboard/filter_values/` accepts the same `property_id`, verifies any
legacy `metric_name`/`metric_type` supplied beside it, and dispatches to the
native value adapter. The shared frontend hook sends the namespaced identity
for Trace/Span/Voice/Sessions/Users, Tasks, alerts, annotation queue pickers,
dashboard/widget value hydration, and dataset-column pickers. Persisted filters
retain legacy native fields for rolling compatibility. Unsupported
cross-adapter filters and breakdowns fail closed.

| Prompt/model/system dimensions                                                      | Stable system definition IDs include their catalog namespace, for example `system_attribute:traces:model`.           | Canonical filtering remains on the corresponding hot column or native resource identity.                      |
| AI grounding and internal RCA/context tools                                         | Consume the same logical kind/name and validate against authorized native results.                                   | They retain purpose-specific exact reads; occurrence counts and trace context are not property-registry data. |

`GET /tracer/dashboard/metrics/?cursor_mode=true` is the new unified definition
reader. It keyset-paginates one activated `property_definition_catalog`
snapshot and does not assemble definition families in the frontend. The
non-cursor response remains a deprecated compatibility shape and does not
inherit the cursor reader's scale claim. Dataset and simulation value adapters
remain native reads. Their Kartik-account DEV UI/API smoke is complete, while
the named release matrix remains pending.

### Registry synchronization strategy

The implemented least-change path is a hybrid:

- The collector publishes observed custom/system attribute values through the
  durable Kafka path after the canonical span write. The catalog consumer
  writes only the isolated value and delivery/control tables.
- System, attribute, eval-template, eval-config, simulation-eval,
  annotation-label, and dataset-column definitions are reconciled into
  `property_definition_catalog` through the same revision envelope.
- Initial backfill is an explicit, bounded operator action. Steady state uses
  exactly one default-off Temporal schedule every **120 seconds** on the
  dedicated `property_catalog_dev_sidecar` queue. A sidecar admits exactly one
  organization/workspace allowlist entry, replica one, and no overlapping run;
  another workspace requires a separate sidecar, queue, and durable volume.
- The scheduled request is resolved by the durable lifecycle in **AUTO** mode:
  normal runs are incremental, while a full repair is selected when the active
  lineage anchor is at least 24 hours old or the lineage reaches 2,048 active
  revisions. There is no second daily cron racing the incremental schedule.
- Dataset cells, trace facts, scores, and prompt executions remain in their
  native indexed stores. The common values API dispatches to the correct
  adapter; it does not duplicate every fact into the definition catalog.

The reviewed DEV rollout keeps its canonical spans source and isolated catalog
target in different databases. Before constructing a target client, inspecting
schema, reading source spans, acquiring a lease, or writing, it proves the exact
allowlisted project set in one read-only repeatable-read PostgreSQL snapshot
through `public.tracer_project` and `public.accounts_workspace`. Duplicate or
missing projects, a project organization/workspace mismatch, or a workspace
organization mismatch fails closed. The same ownership is revalidated inside
the revision snapshot and immediately before source, relational, publish,
fence, and activation boundaries; an immutable authorization/execution proof
binds that ownership to the reviewed request. Soft-deleted projects remain
eligible only so full repair can publish tombstones, and they must pass the same
exact ownership proof.

A tombstone is exact for a single definition such as a dataset column. It is
not exact for a shared observed value: deleting one trace containing a model
must not hide that value while other traces still contain it. Shared mutable
vocabularies therefore require a contribution/refcount ledger (the annotation
pattern) or a fenced immutable epoch (the span-catalog pattern).

`GET /model-hub/develops/{experiment_dataset_id}/get-experiment-dataset-table/`
shares the expanded response serializer, so generated clients see optional
exact-pagination metadata fields, but its runtime did **not** gain exact mode.
It now counts and slices the ordered PostgreSQL queryset before hydrating only
the requested cells, with `page_size<=100`, a 100,000-row offset ceiling,
projection/response caps, and one 8.5-second shrinking read wall. It still has
no signed cross-request snapshot cursor and remains pending endpoint-scale DEV
evidence.

Latest current-tree evidence includes one 363-test offline
property/unified-catalog, schema-contract, and deployment/schedule gate, plus an
84-test offline qualifier suite: 72 qualification-contract tests, five assembly
tests, and seven safety tests. The
Go property catalog package also passes in normal, race, and vet modes. The
machine inventory proves 65 impacted operations (32 direct plus 33
transitive-only) through 48 changed definitions. These local gates prove
implementation and harness contracts, not named-customer endpoint latency.

The final integration pass also has 200 request-wall/error-boundary tests, 166
bounded adjacent-read backend tests, 153 active frontend read-consumer tests,
and 112 generated contract tests green. Charts now performs runtime query
validation and publishes a shaped single/all-system/eval-series response under
one outer 9.5-second wall. Project, automation-rule, eval-metric, eval-task
detail/log, experiment-row, and dataset-point consumers use one visible-action
wall of at most nine seconds, preserve prior truth, reject malformed payloads,
and offer Retry. The 14 changed eval-task, automation, and simulation mutation
operations remain outside the interactive-read SLA pending mutation-specific
idempotency or asynchronous acceptance evidence.

The current `0817j` activation contains exactly the six isolated catalog
tables. Its project-scoped DEV smoke covered Observe property/value search,
cursor continuation, Primary Graph, Eval Settings, annotation automation,
dashboard/widget selectors, dataset selection, and both simulation selectors.
For project `2843b914-d1f7-4ea0-869d-77fa93ce45dc`, custom key
`ai_interruption_rate` and the three project-owned annotation labels were
present while unrelated project-only properties were absent. The frontend
picker regression suite passes 135 tests. The source-bound dense/sparse/voice
nine-window matrix, named population evidence, and all production catalog work
remain pending. Production requires a complete exact-current-source matrix and
separate user approval.

DEV graph/dashboard preparation had a separate deployment-skew failure: the
backend scheduled `tracer.refresh_exact_aggregation_snapshot` to `tasks_xl`,
whose old worker had not registered that activity. DEV now routes it to the
dedicated additive `exact_aggregation` worker built from the matching core/EE
stack. A fresh filtered graph activity completed successfully; its individual
ClickHouse SELECTs took 4.12–49.84 ms and the full activity completed in about
0.3 seconds. The existing shared worker and database were not modified.

The base API optimization at `e25fcf1286d318bc9694e786b6fb2c3c26daa1a8`
did not include the unified catalog. Catalog implementation parent
`a0b7eb6f28471cd40996caf392934a077b95cedc` remains only a historical evidence
anchor; the current freeze must be qualified independently.

The contracts below are implementation inventory and release acceptance
criteria, not evidence of a completed production run. At the superseded core
commit `6f70756d394cec5971db35507e3638f713de3fb0`, the prior isolated production
attempt produced no result JSON. Its artifacts were quarantined when `dev`
advanced, so the complete live Whatfix, Colektia, and Mudflap matrix must run
against the exact current freeze after DEV qualification and separate approval.

All six public Observe/prototype list actions now start one 9.5-second wall
before request validation and tenant/project PostgreSQL scope work. Every
PostgreSQL statement receives a shrinking transaction-local timeout; the same
deadline continues through ClickHouse, enrichment, continuation construction,
and response publication. The trace, span, and session graph actions and all
three user-graph actions follow the same one-wall rule across PostgreSQL
scope/config reads and graph execution. Expiry returns a sanitized retryable
`503`; a late result is never published as success.

For a successful single-project filtered Observe read, trace/span/session list
metadata and the voice top-level envelope publish
`query_applied_filter_version`, `query_applied_filter_sha256`, and
`query_applied_filter_count`. The digest is bound to the authorized project,
observe type, and exact non-window conjunction handed to the builder/cache
identity; an unfiltered/date-only response does not fabricate a non-time filter
attestation.

## Schema and ingestion scope

There is still no mutation or DDL on the canonical ClickHouse `spans` table.
The unified catalog uses exactly six isolated ClickHouse tables created by
three clean schema files:

1. `property_definition_catalog`
2. `span_attribute_value_catalog`
3. `property_catalog_checkpoints`
4. `property_catalog_activations`
5. `property_catalog_deliveries`
6. `property_catalog_source_streams`

Schema `025_property_catalog_data.sql` creates the definition and hot-value
tables, `026_property_catalog_state.sql` creates checkpoint/activation state,
and `027_property_catalog_delivery.sql` creates delivery/source-stream state.
Only the first table stores definitions; only the second stores observed span
attribute values; the remaining four are control-plane ledgers. No source
table, trigger, materialized view, or backfill is attached to canonical spans.

Adjacent, separately gated schema work remains:

- PostgreSQL migration `0123` installs the categorical annotation vocabulary,
  contribution markers, per-label revision, per-organization readiness, and a
  deferred organization-serialized maintenance trigger. A tenant's blocked or
  unscoped Score cannot disable another tenant's picker. The read feature
  remains off until its resumable organization-scoped backfill and audit gate
  prove readiness.
- PostgreSQL migration `0124` is non-atomic and online: it creates only the
  O(1) dataset-table revision ledger, then commits each statement-level
  Dataset/Row/Column/Cell trigger separately. It performs no Dataset-to-Row
  aggregate. Existing datasets stay `is_ready=false` until the bounded,
  resumable `backfill_dataset_table_revision_ledgers` operator command locks
  one ledger row, establishes its exact active-row count, and publishes that
  dataset. Exact reads fail closed for every unready dataset; deploy/enable the
  exact Ground Truth frontend only after `--audit-only --gate` passes.
  Every migration DDL operation is sent as one PgBouncer-safe simple-query
  script with a three-second lock timeout and finite statement timeout, so a
  hot-table lock conflict aborts that idempotent operation for retry instead of
  indefinitely queueing application writers.
  This is an in-place pre-release rewrite and assumes `0124` has never been
  applied; any environment with an older applied `0124` requires a new repair
  migration instead of this rollout.

Dataset exact-read rollout is therefore: apply the unapplied `0124` in the
one-shot migration job; repeatedly run
`backfill_dataset_table_revision_ledgers` (default maximum 100 datasets per
invocation); run
`backfill_dataset_table_revision_ledgers --audit-only --gate`; then and only
then deploy/enable the exact Ground Truth frontend. The command is authorized
only through the existing local explicit-mutation mode or the hosted
`SERVICE_TYPE=bootstrap`, `STARTUP_DB_MUTATION_MODE=operator` job.

The earlier API optimization also adds two concurrent partial PostgreSQL
indexes on `EvalLogger` for bounded usage reads:

- `eval_logger_task_created_idx` on
  `(eval_task_id, created_at, id)`;
- `eval_log_task_cfg_created_idx` on
  `(eval_task_id, custom_eval_config, created_at, id)`.

Both indexes apply only where `eval_task_id IS NOT NULL AND deleted = false`.
They add no table, column, or constraint.

The merged `dev` dependency also changes the existing ClickHouse
`usage_apicalllog.eval_score` materialized expression so scalar and structured
eval outputs share one numeric score and restores its `idx_eval_score` skip
index. ClickHouse requires the index to be dropped before `MODIFY COLUMN` and
re-added afterward. Historical parts are populated only by the separate,
explicitly authorized `backfill_eval_score` command; that command can issue
DROP/MODIFY/ADD/MATERIALIZE mutations and is **not** part of this release
qualifier. The SELECT-only pod must retain
`NO_STARTUP_DB_MUTATIONS=true` and `STARTUP_DB_MUTATION_MODE=disabled`, and the
harness must reject any mutation dispatch. Thus qualification neither applies
DDL nor runs/materializes the backfill; deployment/backfill is a distinct
reviewed operation.

## Release qualification acceptance matrix

The current-source qualifier statically schedules **14 reviewed read route
callbacks**: 11 GET routes and three SELECT-only POST graph routes.
It runs as six sequential, source-bound shards (`whatfix`, `colektia`,
`mudflap`, `trace_system`, `whatfix_graphs`, and `colektia_graphs`) over one
frozen end time. Applicable row-list routes
cover default/date, one discovered dense or sparse custom property,
`has_eval=true|false`, one observed exact eval value,
`has_annotation=true|false`, one observed exact annotation value, and the F7
custom+eval+annotation conjunction across nine intervals. Discovery accepts an
eval or annotation value only from a complete, exact public `filter_values`
page; configured choices alone are not population evidence. The corresponding
long-window filtered list must also return a concrete row identity before an
exact eval, annotation, or F7 lane can qualify. Signed list and property
continuations, semantically stable dual-chain repeats, cursor fencing, exact
Model value pages, Users, and mandatory ready-gated dataset and simulation
previews remain covered. Timestamped cursor bytes may differ across repeat
requests; both tokens must independently yield the same ordered, disjoint
continuation. The exact dataset representative must have a live column; the metrics
catalog must select its exact `dataset_column:<column UUID>` definition and
publish the same redacted representative binding. A missing authorized
representative population now fails the release qualifier instead of becoming
an optional gap. The graph program separately uses the rediscovered Whatfix
dense and Colektia sparse targets and covers all 11 filter profiles across nine
windows and trace, span, and session graph kinds for each (297 lanes per target;
594 graph lanes total). Every filtered list/graph response must publish
`canonical-json-sha256-v1`, a lowercase 64-hex digest, and the nonnegative leaf
count for canonical JSON `{project_id, observe_type, filters}`. The attested
filters are the exact server-bound non-window conjunction used by the builder
or cache identity, sorted order-independently with integral numbers normalized.
Positive base-window bounds are excluded from that digest; every graph response
instead publishes its exact UTC query window and a complete, ordered, gap-free
bucket sequence. Datetime complements remain attested filter leaves. The
per-shard hard fuse is 600 callbacks; exact worst cases are 564, 564, 284, 544,
381, and 353, with the largest callback-only wall at 5,076 seconds below the
5,280-second harness wall. Its source map, execution graph, semantic
filter/window proof, response-size wall, forked-process hard deadline,
request/ClickHouse ceilings, and mutation tripwires pass 84 offline tests.
That proves the test program, not the named-customer data outcome: there is no
qualifying exact-current-source production route-matrix result, so the Whatfix,
Colektia, and Mudflap population/correctness/latency gates below remain pending.
An earlier source-bound US matrix stopped at named-target rediscovery before any
API request. The later isolated DEV attempt also stopped before qualifier API
callbacks when canonical PostgreSQL ownership disagreed with the requested
catalog tenant; its `0815i` catalog and smoke are failure/mechanics evidence,
not functional qualification.

The executable set is intentionally smaller than the 65-operation generated-
contract diff documented in
[`TH7247_INTERACTIVE_READ_MATRIX.md`](TH7247_INTERACTIVE_READ_MATRIX.md).
Mutation and evaluator operations are excluded. The sampled legacy attribute-
values endpoint cannot prove exactness; attribute detail can schedule a refresh;
prototype lists, eval-task usage/lists, and exports are inventory/local-test
lanes rather than callbacks in this current qualifier.
The exact 13 changed operations scheduled and 52 changed operations absent from
the live callback set are enumerated in the interactive matrix's
[exact live-qualifier boundary](TH7247_INTERACTIVE_READ_MATRIX.md#exact-live-qualifier-boundary).

### Route applicability

- The nine frozen windows apply to nine row-list profiles for
  Whatfix/Colektia trace, span, and session lists and Mudflap voice: default,
  custom, eval-present, eval-absent, observed exact eval, annotation-present,
  annotation-absent, observed exact annotation, and F7. Observe routes use
  signed timestamped cursors; each requested repeat must preserve order and
  continuation truth, and both issued tokens must independently resume to the
  same disjoint next page. Default Users lists are also exercised.
- Trace, span, and session graphs run all 11 default/custom/system/eval/
  annotation/conjunction profiles across all nine windows with refresh disabled,
  separately using the Whatfix dense and Colektia sparse targets. Date-only
  responses may use the approved materialized rollup; filtered responses must
  be exact and publish the response-bound canonical filter digest/count plus
  exact UTC window. Users graph and dashboard query remain compiler/local-test
  lanes and are not part of this SELECT-only program.
- Attribute keys, dashboard values/metrics, exact dataset rows, and simulation
  previews have endpoint-specific signed continuation and repeatability checks;
  they do not accept the same date/F0-F7 Cartesian matrix. Metrics must include
  and search the exact dataset-column definition chosen for the mandatory exact
  dataset lane, with both lanes publishing one representative binding.
- Prototype trace/span lists, eval-task usage/lists, compatibility session
  values, and bounded exports remain in the broader inventory but are not
  executable lanes in this qualifier. Their local or historical evidence must
  not be presented as a current-source live result.
- F5 eval positive/negative/exact, F6 annotation positive/negative/exact, and F7
  custom+eval+annotation are scheduled for applicable row-list routes and for
  each of the three graph kinds. Dashboard forms remain outside this qualifier.
- Historical/continuous resolution is not a public GET route. SELECT-only
  qualification may exercise candidate/classifier reads, but must not call
  create/update/unpause, reconciliation, cursor advancement, or scheduling
  operations.

The current qualifier's applicable telemetry acceptance windows are:

| Qualifier ID | Qualification interval |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 30m          | 30 minutes             |
| 1h           | 1 hour                 |
| 6h           | 6 hours                |
| 24h          | 24 hours               |
| 7d           | 7 days                 |
| 30d          | 30 days                |
| 90d          | 90 days                |
| 180d         | 180 days               |
| 365d         | 365 days (12 months)   |

Required population profiles:

- **Dense:** Whatfix trace data; page one, page two, page four/former late-page
  failure boundary, and at least ten distinct key cursor advances.
- **Sparse:** Colektia/Colly trace data; empty advancing checkpoints, rare
  keys/values, truthful exhaustion, and repeatability.
- **Voice:** Mudflap voice data; property parity plus eval/annotation positive
  and negative membership.

Required filter combinations for applicable trace, span, session, and voice
row-list routes:

| ID  | Filter cell                                                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F0  | Date/project only                                                      |
| F1  | System field                                                           |
| F2  | Sparse custom property/value                                           |
| F3  | Dense custom property/value                                            |
| F4  | System plus custom property                                            |
| F5  | `has_eval=true\|false` and exact eval value                            |
| F6  | `has_annotation=true\|false`; positive requires every configured label |
| F7  | Custom property plus eval plus annotation conjunction                  |

For each applicable row-list route, default/custom cells repeat and exercise
continuation in every window. To bound production load, new F5/F6/F7 cells use
one exact first-page callback from 30m through 180d and repeat plus an optional
advancing continuation at 365d. Signed cursor routes must prove cursor
advancement without overlap; numbered prototype routes must prove stable page
boundaries or a truthful finite `422`/`503`. Exact-order
routes must prove no duplicate/gap publication. When a session response carries
inexact flags and `spans_per_session_candidate` provenance, qualification must
instead validate its disclosed candidate ordering and the exact membership of
every published row. All routes must prove
project/workspace fencing, exact positive/negative filter membership, and an
identical repeat where the profile schedules one. A missing positive
configuration, observed value, conjunction, negative-complement witness, or
representative continuation is a named population gap, not a passing cell.

## Latency and read-more contract

These are release gates, not claims that the pending live matrix has passed.

- Active property-key and dashboard-value picker **physical requests** must
  complete in under five seconds. The dashboard-value server read wall is four
  seconds; the active picker transport timeout is 4.8 seconds.
- Trace/span/session/voice list and eval/annotation filter requests must
  complete in under 9.8 seconds (the product requirement is under 10 seconds).
- Compatibility span values, dashboard metrics, compatibility session values,
  warm/read-only attribute detail, eval-task list/usage, and bounded export each
  require their own under-9.8-second endpoint gate where safely applicable; no
  successful live artifact currently proves those gates.
- Property-key and dashboard-value Load more/Retry actions are explicit,
  single-flight, one-physical-request actions. Observe list helpers may issue an
  initial request plus up to twelve bounded continuations inside one visible
  page attempt and its shared 9.5-second action wall. Window focus, remount,
  reconnect, inertial scrolling, and React Query refetch do not replay cached
  infinite pages.
- A malformed/repeated picker cursor fails safely, preserves already loaded
  rows, and offers one bounded fresh-chain retry. It never masquerades as
  exhaustion. Observe list continuation failures preserve published rows and
  expose their bounded Continue/Retry state.
- Retained cursor-catalog and exact row-list request/query/page budgets are work
  bounds, not hidden history or result caps. Cursor-capable endpoints carry a
  signed continuation when more retained data exists. Compatibility samples,
  fixed-horizon snapshots, usage samples, and bounded exports retain the
  explicit windows/caps documented above; numbered endpoints expose their
  documented bounded terminal or error contract.

## Explicit release boundaries

- Key `q` is an exact-key accelerator. Full substring discovery requires
  explicit retained-catalog pagination; this PR does not add a substring
  index.
- `/api/traces/span-attribute-values/` is a sampled recent six-hour
  compatibility endpoint, not retained-history value pagination.
- A cold `/api/traces/span-attribute-detail/` read is not safely qualifiable by
  the current SELECT-only harness: a cache miss may take a cache claim and
  dispatch exact-snapshot work even when `refresh=false`. The qualification
  tripwires must not be weakened; this route needs a pre-existing readable
  snapshot or a genuine no-schedule read mode before it can receive a live
  SELECT-only pass.
- `/tracer/trace-session/get_session_filter_values/` is numbered compatibility
  pagination with no active frontend caller, and trace export is one bounded
  CSV page rather than an exhaustive cursor walk.
- Cursor-backed categorical annotation values use the exact configured plus
  stored-value projection only after migration/backfill/readiness succeeds.
  Until then the feature flag remains off; the bounded compatibility reader
  either proves exhaustion or fails closed, and wide no-page-size scopes do
  not publish a sampled prefix.
- Dataset/simulation value adapters use exact finite signed pagination when
  `page_size` is supplied. The no-page compatibility call returns a complete
  vocabulary only below its finite cap; wider inventories return `422` and
  require a more specific search. Kartik-account DEV UI/API smoke passed, but
  these adapters remain outside the formal dense/sparse/voice release matrix.
- The current implementation adds independent ingestion-fed lookup storage
  without modifying the existing spans table or using a materialized view.
  Local direct/Kafka protocol tests are green. The fresh `0817j` target has one
  contiguous activated build across the reviewed 33-project Kartik scope, and
  DEV readers are enabled only for that workspace. No DEV artifact authorizes
  a production rollout.
